Goal: Add a GLOBAL, STICKY HEADER NAV for the mobile PWA that’s route-aware and tournament-aware, while keeping existing bottom tabs. One cohesive feature → ONE checkpoint.

Stack context: Vite + Express + TypeScript, Wouter for routing, React Query for data. Read and follow replit.md. Keep diffs tight.

Deliverables:
1) <AppHeader/> (sticky, mobile-safe):
   - Safe area support: padding-top uses env(safe-area-inset-top); 56–64px tall.
   - Left: context/back button (if not at root), app/tournament switcher:
       * If a tournament is active, show: “SW Monthly Golf” on first line (small), and the tournament short name + date on second line.
       * Tapping the title takes me to /tournaments list (to pick another event).
   - Center/Title: route-aware title (e.g., “Players”, “Courses”, “Tournament”, “Groups”, “Score”, “Leaderboards”).
   - Right actions (compact icon buttons, with aria-labels & tooltips):
       * On /players: “Add Player”
       * On /courses: “Add Course”
       * On /tournaments/[id]: “Add Player to Event”
       * On /tournaments/[id]/groups: “New Group”, and a time icon to edit tee time
       * On /score: “Undo” (one-step) and “Settings”
       * Kebab (•••) menu for overflow actions per route
   - Visuals: subtle bottom border/shadow; brand green accents; dark mode auto.

2) Route header config:
   - Create a small registry (map of path patterns → {title, actions[]}) so header content is declarative.
   - Works with Wouter: match dynamic routes like /tournaments/:id and /tournaments/:id/groups.

3) State + context:
   - Add a lightweight “activeTournament” client context (id, name, date) consumed by <AppHeader/>. Keep it in sync when navigating into a tournament detail page.
   - If no active tournament, header shows only app title and back/none.

4) Accessibility:
   - All icons have aria-labels.
   - Header height doesn’t overlap content (content gets top padding equal to header height + safe area).
   - Keyboard focus styles visible.

5) Tests (Vitest + @testing-library/react):
   - Header renders correct title on /players, /courses, /tournaments/:id, /tournaments/:id/groups.
   - Action buttons appear/vanish per route config.
   - “Back” appears when not at root; title tap navigates to /tournaments.

6) Docs:
   - README: short section on header config (how to add a new route title/action).

Acceptance (before creating the single checkpoint):
- Sticky header renders on all main routes, with correct title/actions and safe-area padding.
- Route registry drives header; changing registry changes header without touching component code.
- Tests and lint pass; README updated.
- EXACTLY ONE checkpoint. Do NOT enable Extended/High-Power/DI.
